HTTP/2
======

Overview
--------

Upgrading to HTTP/2 is largely transparent. It requires:

* an ASGI server which supports is (e.g. `Hypercorn <https://pgjones.gitlab.io/hypercorn/>`_)
* :doc:`TLS incryption </ssl>`

HTTP Push
---------

There is a feature called `HTTP/2 server push <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2_Server_Push>`_ which allows the server to notify the client of urls
required by the document being served before the client has received the document.

This can be implemented in the following manner:

.. code-block:: python

    async def test_page(scope: Scope, info: Info, matches: RouteMatches, content: Content) -> HttpResponse:
        html = """
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title>Example 1</title>
        <script src="/clickHandler.js"></script>
      </head>
      <body>
        <h1>Example 1</h1>
        <button type="button" onclick="handleClick('here')">
            Click me
        </button>
        <p id="here" />
        <script
      </body>
    </html>

    """
        pushes = [
            ('/clickhandler.js', [(b'accept', b'text/javascript')])
        ]
        return 200, [(b'content-type', b'text/html')], text_writer(html), pushes
